    "> LendingClub enables borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between \\\\$1,000 and \\\\$40,000. The standard loan period is three years. Investors are able to search and browse the loan listings on LendingClub website and select loans that they want to invest in based on the information supplied about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Institutional investors make money from the interest on these loans. LendingClub makes money by charging borrowers an origination fee and investors a service fee.\n",
